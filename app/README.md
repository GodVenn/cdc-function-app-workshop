# Get started

We use Poetry to manage dependencies. \
If you don't already have it installed, follow the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

After installing Poetry:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Run `poetry install --no-root`
3. Run `poetry run python app.py`
